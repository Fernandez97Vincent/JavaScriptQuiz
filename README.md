# JavaScriptQuiz
The quiz is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently, the rendering portion of the assignment is not working properly and only displays one question and at static positions. I would like to use a loop to loop through the questions and have the answer choices appear at different parts every time the start button is pressed. As of now, the timer and display question is working properly. As for the wrong and correct answer, I plan on using an if else statement to see if the selected answer is the correct answer, then have the timer count down if the selected answer is incorrect.
